# Objective:
# Students will use logical (and, or, not) and chained comparison operators in Python to build compound conditions.

# Key Notes:

# and → Both conditions must be True

# or → At least one condition must be True

# not → Inverts True/False

# You can chain comparisons: 1 < x < 5

# Examples:
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 15)   # True
print(x < 5 or x == 10)   # True
print(not(x == 10))       # False
print(1 < x < 20)         # True

# score calculator
score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))
if 90 <= score < 100:
    print("Grade: A")

elif 80 <= score < 90:
    print("Grade: B")

elif 70 <= score < 80:
    print("Grade: C")

elif 60 <= score < 70:
    print("Grade: D")

else: 
    print("Grade: F")

# Practice Problems:

# Write an expression that checks if a number is between 50 and 100 (inclusive).

# Write an expression that checks if a number is NOT equal to 0 and greater than 10.

# Use chained comparison to check if 3 < 4 < 5.
